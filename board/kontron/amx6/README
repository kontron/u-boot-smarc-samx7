Building AMX6 Bootloader Image
------------------------------

a) Serial download bootloader image

# make distclean
# make amx6_solo_defconfig (for Solo/DualLite module)
# make amx6_quad_defconfig (for Quad/Dual module)
# make

This will create the u-boot.imx image file that can be used to boot the
module in serial download mode.

b) SPI flash bootloader image

# make distclean
# make amx6_spl_defconfig
# make

This will create the final u-boot-with-spl.imx image that already contains
SPL part.

It is possible to pass a release version when building. To achieve this, the
IDENT_RELEASE macro has to be defined. This can be done with the following
build step:

# IDENT_RELEASE=<release_string> make


Booting the AMX6 Module
-----------------------
AMX6 CPU fuses are configured to boot from SPI flash device. In addition,
serial download mode via USB OTG port can be used. For serial download boot,
the serial download bootloader image as described above is used.


Bootloder Update from CLI
-------------------------
Provided the board has been booted to bootloader CLI prompt (either from SPI
flash or using serial download mode), bootloader can be updated as shown
below.

1. Load bootloader SPI flash image file into RAM, e.g. from USB thumb device

==> usb start
==> load usb 0 ${loadaddr} u-boot-with-spl.imx

2. Update bootloader image in flash

==> sf probe 2
==> sf erase 0 80000 && sf write ${loadaddr} 400 $filesize


OS Update using USB Mass Storage Functionality
----------------------------------------------
Provided that the AMX6 module has been attached to a host PC vi USB OTG port,
the 'ums' command from bootloader CLI can be used to present either eMMC or
SD card as a block device to the host machine. This can be used for
partitioning and filesystem installation on the module using standard OS
(linux) commands like fdisk, mkfs, mount etc.


- Attach the eMMC as a block device on the host PC from u-boot CLI:

==> ums 0 mmc 2


- Create partition and filesystem on eMMC from host PC:

# sudo fdisk /dev/sdX       - create partition on eMMC from fdisk shell
# sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1

Note: eMMC device name depends on the host machine used. Be careful to not
      overwrite host machine internal disk drives.

- Mount filesystem and install a rootfs image to eMMC

# sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt
# sudo tar xzpf <rootfsimg.tar.gz> -C /mnt
