Building SMX7 bootloader image
------------------------------

There are 2 bootloader flavours for the SMX7, first one is to be used with serial
downloader boot, the second one is copied to QSPI flash and started from there.

To build SMX7 bootloader, a recent ARM toolchain >= 6.0.0 is recommended. In the
build shell, the CROSS_COMPILE environment variable has to be set and exported
accordingly (e.g. export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-).

a) Serial download bootloader image

# make distclean
# make smx7_defconfig
# make

The resulting bootloader image will be u-boot.imx. It can be used with a serial
download tool (e.g. usb_imx) to boot the module.

b) QSPI flash bootloader image

# make distclean
# make smx7_spl_defconfig
# make u-boot-with-spl.imx

The resulting bootloader image will be u-boot-with-spl.imx. In bootloader default
environment the 'uboot_update' script is defined that can be used to update a
given bootloader image via TFTP network connection.

c) eMMC redundant bootloader image

# make distclean
# make smx7_mmc_spl_defconfig
# make u-boot-with-spl.imx

The resulting bootloader image will be u-boot-with-spl.imx. It is installed
at block 0 _and_ at block 0x800 on the first boot partition of the eMMC.
Note that this is a fully redundant bootloader implementation that can be
controlled via external GPIO, in this implementation the LID signal from
Kontron eval carrier 2 is used to force booting either from block 0 (standard
boot, LID# jumper not set) or from block 0x800 (recovery boot, LID# jumper
installed).
Note also that this only serves as a proof of concept if redundant eMMC boot.
In a real world application, probably more changes would be necessary. E.g.
bootloader environment still comes from QSPI flash, this would probably
be changed in productive use.

To install the bootloader image on eMMC the following steps are required (It
is assumed that the bootloader has been copied via network or other means into
RAM memory at $loadaddr before). The image must be installed beginning with
the 2nd block (offset 0x400).

=> mmc dev 1 1
=> mmc write $loadaddr 0x002 0x7fe
=> mmc write $loadaddr 0x802 0x7fe

In addition, i.MX7 boot config fuses must be set appropriately to boot from
eMMC. Note that this is not possible if fuses have been burnt for QSPI boot
before.

=> fuse prog -y 1 3 10002800

d) external SPI boot bootloader image

# make distclean
# make smx7_extspi_spl_defconfig
# make -j8

The resulting bootloader image will be u-boot-with-spl.imx. It is installed
starting at offset 0x400 in external SPI flash. Note that the module can
only boot from external SPI flash after hardware modification. Note also
that this must be considered as proof of concept, in real applications,
further modification is probably necessary.


It is possible to pass a release version when building. To achieve this, the
IDENT_RELEASE macro has to be defined. This can be done with the following
build step:

# IDENT_RELEASE=<release_string> make u-boot-with-spl.imx
